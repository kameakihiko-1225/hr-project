### Production Build
- Vite builds frontend to `dist/public`
- ESBuild bundles backend to `dist/index.js`
- Static file serving through Express
- Database migrations via Drizzle

### Environment Configuration

### Architectural Decisions

**Database Choice**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM was chosen for type safety, performance, and serverless compatibility with Neon Database.

**Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript provides strong typing and component reusability, while Shadcn/ui ensures consistent design system implementation.

**Authentication Strategy**: JWT tokens with server-side validation balance security with stateless scalability requirements.

**File Storage**: Custom file upload system with validation provides flexibility for future cloud storage integration.

**Internationalization**: i18next supports the multi-language requirements for Uzbekistan's diverse linguistic landscape.
