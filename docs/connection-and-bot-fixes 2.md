# Connection and Bot Fixes

## Database Connection Management

We've made several improvements to the database connection management in the application to address connection pool timeout issues:

1. **Fixed Invalid Prisma Configuration**:
   - Removed invalid `connectionTimeout` and `pool` properties from PrismaClient configuration
   - Used only valid Prisma configuration options

2. **Improved Connection Retry Logic**:
   - Added robust retry logic with exponential backoff for database connections
   - Implemented proper error handling for connection failures

3. **Added Graceful Shutdown**:
   - Implemented proper connection cleanup on server shutdown
   - Added signal handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT

4. **Added Connection Health Middleware**:
   - Created middleware to check database connection health before processing requests
   - Skip checks for non-database routes to improve performance

5. **Enhanced Health Check Endpoint**:
   - Improved `/api/db/health` endpoint with better diagnostics
   - Added connection pool metrics to health checks

## Telegram Bot Fixes

### 1. Fixed enhancedAiService Reference

**Issue**: `ReferenceError: enhancedAiService is not defined` in phase2InterviewConversation function

**Solution**:
- Added a constant `TOTAL_PHASE2_QUESTIONS = 10` at the top of the phase2InterviewConversation function
- Replaced all references to `enhancedAiService.TOTAL_PHASE2_QUESTIONS` with this constant
- This approach avoids issues with module imports while maintaining the same functionality

### 2. Conversation Session Initialization

**Issue**: `TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'currentNavigationStep')`

**Solution**:
- Ensured conversation session is properly initialized at the beginning of conversation handlers
- Added checks to initialize session if it doesn't exist: `if (!conversation.session) { conversation.session = ctx.session ?? {}; }`

### 3. Other Bot-Related Fixes

- Improved error handling in webhook processing
- Added better logging for bot-related errors
- Ensured proper cleanup of resources

## Best Practices

1. **Use Global Singleton for PrismaClient**:
   ```typescript
   // Good - Use global singleton
   import { prisma } from '../lib/prisma';
   
   // Bad - Don't do this
   const prisma = new PrismaClient();
   ```

2. **Handle Transaction Errors Properly**:
   ```typescript
   try {
     await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
       // Database operations
     });
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('Transaction failed:', error);
     // Handle error appropriately
   }
   ```

3. **Properly Initialize Conversation Sessions**:
   ```javascript
   if (!conversation.session) {
     conversation.session = ctx.session ?? {};
   }
   ```

4. **Use Constants for Magic Numbers**:
   ```javascript
   const TOTAL_PHASE2_QUESTIONS = 10;
   // Use TOTAL_PHASE2_QUESTIONS instead of hardcoded 10
   ```

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. Set up alerts for connection pool exhaustion
2. Monitor database query performance regularly
3. Implement logging for slow queries
4. Periodically review connection usage patterns
