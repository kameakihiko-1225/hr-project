# Conversation Session Fix

## Issue

When using the Telegram bot, the following error was occurring:

```
Error starting interview flow: TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'currentNavigationStep')
```

This error was occurring in the `startInterviewFlow` function when trying to set `conversation.session.currentNavigationStep = 'interview'`, but `conversation.session` was undefined in some cases.

## Solution

We fixed the issue by adding a check at the beginning of the `startInterviewFlow` function to ensure that `conversation.session` exists, and initializing it if it doesn't:

```javascript
async function startInterviewFlow(conversation, ctx, positionId, botData) {
  try {
    // Ensure conversation.session exists
    if (!conversation.session) {
      console.log('[Bot] ⚠️ No conversation session in startInterviewFlow - initializing');
      conversation.session = ctx.session ?? {};
    }
    
    // Rest of the function...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error starting interview flow:', error);
    await ctx.reply('❌ Error starting interview. Please try again.');
  }
}
```

This pattern is already used in other conversation functions like `navigationConversation`, `phase1InterviewConversation`, and `phase2InterviewConversation`, but was missing in the `startInterviewFlow` function.

## Why This Fix Works

The grammy conversations plugin manages conversation state, but in some cases, the `conversation.session` object might not be initialized properly when a conversation is entered directly from a callback or command handler. By checking if `conversation.session` exists at the beginning of the function and initializing it if needed, we ensure that we can safely set properties on it without causing errors.

## Testing

To test this fix:
1. Click on the "Apply via AI" button for any position card or job card.
2. The system should generate a deeplink with the actual position ID.
3. When the Telegram bot opens, it should display the details of the selected position.
4. The bot should then guide the user through the application process for that specific position without any errors.
