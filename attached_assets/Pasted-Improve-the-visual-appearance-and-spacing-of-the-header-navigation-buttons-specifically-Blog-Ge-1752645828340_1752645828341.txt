Improve the visual appearance and spacing of the header navigation buttons, specifically "Blog", "Get in Touch", "Apply Now", and the language switcher "EN".

Constraints to Reiterate (from previous prompts):

PRESERVE EXISTING UI/UX DESIGN (Overall Layout): No fundamental changes to the header's overall structure, logo placement, or the order of elements. The improvements are strictly confined to the buttons themselves and the space between them.

PRESERVE PROPER NOUNS: "Millat Umidi Group" should remain untranslated.

Functional Language Switcher: The "EN" button is part of the language switcher and its functionality for switching languages should be maintained.

Instructions for the AI Code Agent:

Uniform Spacing Between Buttons:

Increase the horizontal spacing between all adjacent navigation buttons in the header ("Blog", "Get in Touch", "Apply Now", "EN").

Ensure this spacing is consistent across all pairs of buttons to create a clean, uncrowded look. Aim for a visually balanced distribution of space.

Adjust Button Padding (if needed):

Review the internal padding (top, bottom, left, right) of each button ("Blog", "Get in Touch", "Apply Now", "EN").

Adjust padding to ensure text inside the buttons doesn't feel cramped, and the buttons have a consistent and comfortable visual size, while staying true to their current overall shape/design (e.g., if they are currently rounded rectangles, they should remain so).

Review "Apply Now" Button:

Ensure the "Apply Now" button's blue color and its current dimensions (width/height) are maintained, unless minor adjustments are necessary for better padding. The primary focus is on its spacing relative to other elements.

Review "EN" (Language Switcher) Button:

Ensure the "EN" button maintains its current border and background style. Focus on its spacing relative to "Apply Now" and its internal padding.

Confirm its functionality as a language switcher remains active.

Maintain Vertical Alignment:

Verify that all buttons and the "Millat Umidi Group" logo remain perfectly vertically aligned within the header. No vertical shifts should occur.

Responsive Check:

After adjustments, ensure the header navigation remains visually appealing and functional on various screen sizes (responsive design). Buttons should not overlap or break layout on smaller screens.

Deliverables:

Updated CSS/styling for header navigation buttons to implement improved, consistent spacing.

Adjusted button padding for better visual comfort, if necessary.

Confirmation that the header layout remains stable and aligned across different screen sizes.
