## **🎨 Frontend UI & Component Design Prompt: "All Applied Positions Listing"**

**🎯 FOCUS:** To precisely define the design and layout for the "All Applied Positions Listing" component, including its interactive pagination.

**📋 CORE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:**

1.  **Strict Placement:** This component must be placed directly below the "Top Applied Positions" component, **still contained within the overall hero section**.

2.  **Overall Aesthetic:**
    * Implement a **"simplicity with modern view" design, drawing inspiration from `Screenshot 2025-07-16 at 2.51.44 PM.png`**.
    * This implies:
        * Clean, minimalist card/list item design for each position.
        * Subtle use of lines, borders, and spacing for a sleek, organized look.
        * Modern typography and a harmonious color palette that complements the hero section's existing design.
        * Subtle animations on hover or load (if feasible without performance impact).
    * The design should prioritize readability, a polished, contemporary feel, and adhere to "best cases" for modern web list design.

3.  **Layout within Each Listing Item (per row):**
    * **Left Side (First Element):** Display **numbering** (e.g., "1.", "2.", "3.", etc.) for each position in the list.
    * **Next to Numbering:** Display the **Localized Position Name**.
    * **Far Right Side:** Display the **Total Applied Count** for that position (e.g., "43 Applied"). The label "Applied" must be localized.
    * Ensure proper spacing and alignment to create a clean, readable, and visually appealing flow across the row.

4.  **Pagination & Interactive Display (CRITICAL):**
    * **Initial Display:** The listing must initially show only the **first 4 positions** from the fetched data.
    * **"View More / View Less" Controls:**
        * If the total number of positions with applicants is greater than 4, a "View More Positions" button/icon must be displayed below the list.
        * **When "View More Positions" is clicked, the full list of positions should be displayed**, and the button should change to "View Less Positions".
        * **When "View Less Positions" is clicked, the listing must revert to displaying only the initial 4 positions**, and the button should change back to "View More Positions".
    * **Localization:** All button texts ("View More Positions", "Показать больше позиций", "Ko'proq lavozimlarni ko'rish" / "View Less Positions", "Показать меньше позиций", "Kamroq lavozimlarni ko'rish") must be correctly localized.
    * The pagination controls should integrate seamlessly with the "simplicity with modern view" aesthetic.

5.  **Localization Integration (Design Impact):**
    * Ensure that text length variations across English (🇺🇸), Uzbek (🇺🇿), and Russian (🇷🇺) do **NOT** cause layout issues, overflow, or visual distortion within the hero section's fixed design constraints.
    * Adjust styling (e.g., font-size, line-height, element width/height) minimally and only if absolutely necessary to prevent breakage, always prioritizing the overall hero section's integrity and the clean, modern aesthetic.

**Deliverables for this Design Section:**
* A pixel-perfect implementation of the "All Applied Positions Listing" component that aligns with the specified layout (numbering, position name, applied count) and the "simplicity with modern view" aesthetic inspired by `Screenshot 2025-07-16 at 2.51.44 PM.png`.
* Fully functional and interactive "View More / View Less" pagination controls.
* Responsive design that maintains visual integrity across various screen sizes and languages.
* Confirmation that the component is strictly confined to its designated area within the hero section and integrates without negatively impacting other hero elements.
