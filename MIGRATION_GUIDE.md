# Bitrix24 File Migration Guide

## Problem Solved
Previously, Telegram file URLs in Bitrix24 contacts would expire after some time, leaving broken links in resume, diploma, and voice answer fields. This system now provides permanent file storage.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Permanent File Storage System
- **New webhook behavior**: All incoming Telegram file IDs are automatically downloaded and stored locally
- **Permanent URLs**: Files get unique URLs like `https://career.millatumidi.uz/uploads/telegram-files/contact-123_resume_2025-07-31_abc12345.pdf`
- **No expiration**: Files remain accessible indefinitely

### 2. Migration Scripts for Existing Data

#### A. Automatic Migration (for valid file IDs)
```bash
# Run migration script to convert valid Telegram file IDs to permanent URLs
npx tsx server/scripts/runMigration.ts
```

#### B. Cleanup Expired URLs
```bash
# Mark expired URLs with clear messages for manual re-upload
npx tsx server/scripts/bitrixFileCleanup.ts
```

### 3. API Endpoints

You can also run these operations via API:

#### Migration API
```bash
curl -X POST https://career.millatumidi.uz/api/migrate-bitrix-files
```

#### Cleanup API  
```bash
curl -X POST https://career.millatumidi.uz/api/cleanup-expired-files
```

## Monitoring

### Success Indicators

## Maintenance

### Recommended Actions
