## Database Setup

To set up the database for this project:

1. Install PostgreSQL locally or use a cloud provider (like Neon)
2. Create a new database for the application
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the database URL
4. Run migrations: `npm run migrate:deploy`
5. Seed the database: `npm run db:seed`
6. Add sample data: `node scripts/seed-sample-data.js`

For more detailed instructions, see [Database Documentation](./docs/database.md).

## Logging System

The application includes a comprehensive logging system to help with debugging and monitoring:

### Logger Features

- **Log Levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
- **Contextual Logging**: Each module has its own logger with context
- **Colorized Output**: Different colors for different log levels
- **Timestamps**: All logs include ISO timestamps
- **Error Details**: Error logs include stack traces

### Key Logging Components

- `src/lib/logger.ts` - Core logging utility
- `src/api/middleware/loggingMiddleware.ts` - Request logging middleware
- `src/api/middleware/errorMiddleware.ts` - Error handling middleware

### Logging in Services

All services include comprehensive logging:

- **Authentication**: Login attempts, successes, failures
- **Database**: Connection events, query execution
- **API**: Request/response details, execution times
- **JWT**: Token generation, verification

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { createLogger } from '@/lib/logger';

// Create a logger with context
const logger = createLogger('myComponent');

// Log at different levels
logger.debug('Detailed information for debugging');
logger.info('General information about application progress');
logger.warn('Warning that might need attention');
logger.error('Error that occurred', new Error('Something went wrong'));
```

## Code Maintenance

### Refactoring Tools

The project includes several tools to help maintain code quality and reduce duplication:

1. **Duplicate Code Analyzer**
   ```bash
   node scripts/refactor-duplicates.js
   ```
   This script analyzes the codebase for duplicate code and generates a report at `docs/code-duplication-report.md`.

2. **Refactoring Implementation**
   ```bash
   node scripts/refactor-implement.js
   ```
   This script implements the refactoring changes identified in the code-refactoring-plan.md document. It updates imports and removes duplicate files.

3. **Unused Component Finder**
   ```bash
   node scripts/find-unused-components.js
   ```
   This script identifies potentially unused components in the project and generates a report at `docs/unused-components-report.md`.

### Best Practices

To maintain code quality and prevent duplication:

1. **Centralize Utilities**: Keep utility functions in dedicated files and import them where needed
2. **Follow DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself - extract common code into reusable functions
3. **Use TypeScript**: Prefer TypeScript over JavaScript for better type safety and tooling
4. **Document Code**: Add JSDoc comments to explain the purpose of functions and classes
5. **Regular Refactoring**: Schedule regular refactoring sessions to clean up the codebase

For more details on the refactoring process, see `docs/code-refactoring-plan.md`.
