üßæ Unified Task Description Prompt for AI Recruiting System (MVP)

‚∏ª

üéØ Objective:

Build a full-stack, AI-powered recruiting system that enables companies to publish jobs, run AI-enhanced interviews via Telegram bots, sync candidate data with Bitrix24, and manage the entire pipeline from a centralized admin dashboard. Admins can create and manage their own companies, positions, bots, and workflows.

‚∏ª

üîë Key Components:

1. Main Website (built in Cursor UI)
	‚Ä¢	Displays open positions dynamically from DB
	‚Ä¢	Includes job filters (company, department, location)
	‚Ä¢	JobCard has ‚ÄúApply via AI‚Äù button ‚Üí launches Telegram bot
	‚Ä¢	Hero/stats sections auto-update with real-time analytics

2. Admin Panel (/admin path only)
	‚Ä¢	Auth-protected dashboard (Supabase or custom auth)
	‚Ä¢	CRUD for: companies, departments, positions, bots, admins
	‚Ä¢	Bitrix24 integration setup with webhook testing & stage mapping
	‚Ä¢	SMS sending to candidates (filter by company/position/stage)
	‚Ä¢	AI Trainer interface for uploading PDFs, .md, .txt, and training the bot
	‚Ä¢	Real-time dashboard: deal stage funnel, bot-user conversion, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Theming (logo, colors) per admin/company

3. Telegram Interview Bot
	‚Ä¢	Created by admin via bot token
	‚Ä¢	Multibot: one bot per admin/company
	‚Ä¢	Two-phase interview:
	‚Ä¢	Phase 1 (hardcoded structured Qs: name, phone, email, age, region, preferred modality, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Phase 2 (AI-generated questions + audio/text reply support + % assessment summary via GPT)
	‚Ä¢	Uses navaistt_v2_medium for speech-to-text
	‚Ä¢	Summary returned to candidate with HR contact info
	‚Ä¢	Syncs result to Bitrix CRM deal (staged by response behavior)
	‚Ä¢	Contains /getFileId command for Telegram content linking
	‚Ä¢	Inactivity handling with cron jobs + auto reminders + failover deal placement

4. Database (PostgreSQL on Neon with pgvector)
	‚Ä¢	Multi-tenant with admin_id scoped RLS policies
	‚Ä¢	Tables: admins, companies, departments, positions, bots, candidates, interviews, documents, bitrix_mappings, crm_deals, chat_sessions, sms_logs, messages_queue
	‚Ä¢	Documents uploaded per position ‚Üí used in GPT-based interview training
	‚Ä¢	Fully normalized + extendable schema

5. Bitrix24 Integration
	‚Ä¢	Admin provides Bitrix webhook (1 per company)
	‚Ä¢	Custom field mapping: contact/deal fields
	‚Ä¢	Stage mapping:
	‚Ä¢	stage_new: initial deal when user joins bot
	‚Ä¢	stage_no_response: user didn‚Äôt reply in time (cron-triggered)
	‚Ä¢	stage_rejected: user clicked ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt apply‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Duplicates checking based on contact/phone/email
	‚Ä¢	Real-time deal creation and updates via webhook triggers

6. AI Interview Logic (ChatGPT-based)
	‚Ä¢	Each position can be trained using:
	‚Ä¢	Uploaded docs (PDF/.md/.txt) ‚Üí vectorized
	‚Ä¢	Manual chat training (correct GPT answers via interactive chat)
	‚Ä¢	GPT assistant uses RAG or prompt injection
	‚Ä¢	Interview summary includes:
	‚Ä¢	% fit for position
	‚Ä¢	strengths/weaknesses (based on user‚Äôs answers)
	‚Ä¢	optional red flags or suggestions

7. Automation (Cron Jobs)
	‚Ä¢	Tracks Telegram bot user inactivity
	‚Ä¢	Sends reminder messages at intervals:
	‚Ä¢	+1h ‚Üí msg 1
	‚Ä¢	+2h ‚Üí msg 2
	‚Ä¢	+3h ‚Üí msg 3
	‚Ä¢	+5h, +8h, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Messages stop if user replies or clicks a CTA
	‚Ä¢	Final fallback: after 5 days ‚Üí mark deal as failed in Bitrix
	‚Ä¢	All logic should avoid re-sending once user replies or blocks the bot

‚∏ª

üß™ Advanced Features (optional in Phase 1):
	‚Ä¢	Recruiter/candidate chat inside admin panel
	‚Ä¢	Auto-matching engine (GPT-based matching of CV to position)
	‚Ä¢	AI-based candidate ranking by department
	‚Ä¢	Multi-language support (UI & bot flow)

‚∏ª

üß± Technologies Used:
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: Next.js App Router + ShadCN + Tailwind
	‚Ä¢	Backend: Neon PostgreSQL + Supabase (or pg/Prisma)
	‚Ä¢	Bot: Node.js + Telegraf + Huggingface Whisper
	‚Ä¢	CRM: Bitrix24 (webhooks only)
	‚Ä¢	AI: OpenAI (token-auth), LangChain (optional), pgvector
	‚Ä¢	Hosting: Vercel (web), Render.com (bot) or custom VPS
	‚Ä¢	Database Security: Row-Level Security for tenant isolation

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Output Goals:
	‚Ä¢	All features scoped within /admin dashboard
	‚Ä¢	One bot per admin/company
	‚Ä¢	All candidate data synced to both local DB and Bitrix
	‚Ä¢	AI interviews are feedback-driven and extensible
	‚Ä¢	The system is deployable on cloud without third-party orchestration tools
